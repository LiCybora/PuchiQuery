# PuchiQuery
A table for easy query of Puchiguru game data

Project site: [https://puchiquery.dynu.net](https://puchiquery.dynu.net). Still 
under construction. Report issue if any thing goes wrong. If you see nothing, 
try browsing it with Firefox/Chrome or Safari on iOS. These are tested and works, 
but untested the any other.

Inspired by [ieb project](https://puchi-next.loveliv.es/), with filter/sorting 
for easy data query.

Most codes are hardcoded and the quality is horrible without any planning. Just 
for easy query, so please don't have too much expectations.

## Translation
If you think the translation is wrong or want more other language(s), you may 
submit pull request with filled `assets/locale/template.json` and rename it to 
your locale code then I will merge it. You may also direct edit the existing json
 if you think the existing translation is wrong, and I will look for it.
