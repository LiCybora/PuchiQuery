# PuchiQuery
A table for easy query of Puchiguru game data

Project site: [https://puchiquery.dynu.net](https://puchiquery.dynu.net). Still 
under construction. Neither IE nor Edge works. Best view on Firefox, but also 
functioning on Chromium and Safari (and iOS). Android default browsers are 
unlikely to work, so mobile Firefox/Chrome is preferred.


Inspired by [ieb project](https://puchi-next.loveliv.es/), with filter/sorting 
for easy data query.

Most codes are hardcoded and the quality is horrible without any planning. Just 
for easy query, so please don't have too much expectations.

## Translation
If you think the translation is wrong or want more other language(s), you may 
submit pull request with filled `template.json` and I will merge it. You may also 
direct edit the existing json if you think the existing translation is wrong, and 
I will look for it.
