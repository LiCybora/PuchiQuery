# PuchiQuery (Âµ'sic Forever!)
A table for easy query of Puchiguru game data

**IMPORTANT: [The game server is closed at the end of May 2019!!!](https://lovelive-puchiguru.jp/campaign/5c89a6c6.html)**

It is sad, I personally like the game very much, but that is reality.

The site will be maintained until that day. After that, it will be archived.

Project site: [https://puchiquery.dynu.net](https://puchiquery.dynu.net). Report 
issue if anything goes wrong. If you see nothing, try browsing it with Firefox/
Chrome. For iOS, scrolling problem is unsolvable even you use Chrome or Firefox. 
The only workaround is portrait view. Save data for iOS also problematic (e.g.: 
filename). Please go complaint fucking Apple instead, changing browser is 
meaningless in iOS as all browsers are Webkit based.

Inspired by [ieb project](https://puchiguru.loveliv.es/), with filter/sorting 
for easy data query idea from [LLSIF Card Explorer](https://card.llsif.moe/).

## Translation
If you think the translation is wrong or cannot find your language(s), you may 
submit pull request with filled `assets/locale/template.json` and rename it to 
your locale code then I will merge it. You may also direct edit the existing json
 if you think the existing translation is wrong, and I will look for it. All 
 translated works will be credited by your GitHub name.
