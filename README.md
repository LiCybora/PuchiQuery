# PuchiQuery
A table for easy query of Puchiguru game data

Project site: [https://puchiquery.dynu.net](https://puchiquery.dynu.net). Report 
issue if anything goes wrong. If you see nothing, try browsing it with Firefox/
Chrome. For iOS, scrolling problem is unsolvable even you use Chrome or Firefox. 
Please go complaint fucking Apple instead. The only workaround is portrait view.

Inspired by [ieb project](https://puchi-next.loveliv.es/), with filter/sorting 
for easy data query.

Most codes are hardcoded and the quality is horrible without any planning. Just 
for easy query, so please don't have too much expectation on feature request, 
but feel free to open issue maybe I will like and implement it at all costs.

## Translation
If you think the translation is wrong or cannot find your language(s), you may 
submit pull request with filled `assets/locale/template.json` and rename it to 
your locale code then I will merge it. You may also direct edit the existing json
 if you think the existing translation is wrong, and I will look for it. All 
 translated works will be credited by your GitHub name.
