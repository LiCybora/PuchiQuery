    <h1 id="range-approximation">Range Approximation</h1>
    <p>As the letter range does not truly reveal the real range, you may rely on the range map like this:</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="assets/img/Range0.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>However, the range only told you affected area, but not mention how many Puchi is affected. Of course with given
        range-to-screen ratio, and we know maximum number of Puchi on screen is 45, we can directly calculated by
        ratio x 45.</p>
    <p>Let's take Raincoat Yoshiko and Pirate Hanayo at Lv 10 as example:</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="assets/img/Range0.PNG">
        <img src="assets/img/Range1.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>Cleared by Yoshiko = 0.14 x 45 = <span style="color:red">6.3</span><br/>Cleared by Hanayo = 0.5 x 45 = 22.5</p>
    <p>You may get shocked. If you have Yoshiko, you know at Lv 10 she at least clear 21, and even more. So what's wrong?
        The given range only represent the affected area. Any Puchi touching that area will take effect, not necessarily
        inside the area. Yoshiko's range is scattered many place, it make no sense for a large Puchi within the tiny grid.
        Therefore, we need to consider boundary case.</p>
    <p>For simplicity, assume all Puchi are 2x2 grids, the screen is 16x16 grids. Then, we take 2x2 maximal filter over
        the 16x16 grids and normalize it. This means for each grid, there are at most 4 possible cases that a Puchi
        occupying this grid. Therefore, we get probability to normalize each grid. Thus, we have this:</p>
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="assets/img/Range2.PNG">
        <img src="assets/img/Range3.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>With some modification, the range looks more close to Yoshiko's real range. The blue indicate the marginal case
        where a Puchi may touch the red grid boundary instead of inside it. The darker of blue, the higher probability
        it touch the red. The new expeceted clear is 13~23. Without taking probability, 23 is close to real. It looks
        good? No, Also perform the same to Hanayo, she now get expected 53.125% range and at most 56.25%, after
        multiplication, she is expected to clear 23~26 Puchi. Again if you have Hanayo, you know it is slightly
        overestimated. What's wrong now?</p>
    <p>We omitted the gravity issue. Due to gravitation, Puchi are not equally distributed everywhere on screen.
        Denser in the middle, and less on top and bottom (due to round angle shaped for bottom). To simply deal with
        this, we just apply penalty for the top, and gradually decrease penalty and becomes rewards at center, and none
        at bottom. For example:</p>
    <p>Top: 50%, +10% per level until 120% reach <br/>Middle 2: 130% <br/>Bottom 3 levels: 100% <br/>
        Others: 120% <br/>Total layers: 16</p>
    Result:
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="assets/img/Capture.PNG">
        <img src="assets/img/Capture1.PNG">
    </div>
    <p>Using new approach, Pirate Hanayo expected clear 21~23 Puchi. It is somehow more accurate. For Yoshiko,
        its expected value goes 14~24. Still underestimated too much for the lower bound, but at least improved.</p>
    <p>What can we do more? Perhaps upsampling both Puchi and screen to higher resolution grid may help, but
        it take too much time to compute.</p>
    <p> I am still looking for an elegant solution. Feel free to open an issue to propose your idea!
